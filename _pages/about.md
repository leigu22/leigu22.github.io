Hi! I am an Assistant Professor in the [Electrical and Systems Engineering Department](https://www.ese.upenn.edu) at the University of Pennsylvania. I am broadly interested in [power electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_electronics) circuits and components and how to design and optimize power conversion systems for applications, such as high-performance computing, renewable energy, and medical devices. I was an visiting researcher in the circuits group at [NVIDIA Research](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/), working on data center power delivery. Before NVIDIA, I worked at Apple. I received my Ph.D. from the [Electrical Engineering Department](https://ee.stanford.edu) at Stanford University in 2019, where I worked with [Juan Rivas](https://profiles.stanford.edu/juan-rivas-davila) in the [SUPER-Lab](https://superlab.stanford.edu).

I lead the Penn Power Electronics Research Lab. My lab focuses on technology innovations centered around wide bandgap devices, high-frequency magnetic components, circuits and architectures, and others to improve the efficiency and shrink the requisite size of power conversion for a wide range of essential applications. [Here](https://leigupe.github.io/research/) highlights some of my past research. I will be taking new graduate students in the foreseeable future (next few years). If you are interested in working with me at Penn, please apply to [Penn Engineeringâ€™s graduate program](https://gradadm.seas.upenn.edu), and feel free to mention my name in your application. Thanks for your interest!
