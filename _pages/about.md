Bio
------
Hi! I am an Assistant Professor in the [Electrical and Systems Engineering Department](https://www.ese.upenn.edu) at the University of Pennsylvania. I am broadly interested in [power electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_electronics) circuits and components and how to design and optimize power conversion systems for applications, such as high-performance computing, renewable energy, and medical devices. I was an visiting researcher in the circuits group at [NVIDIA Research](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/). Before NVIDIA, I worked at Apple. I received my Ph.D. from the [Electrical Engineering](https://ee.stanford.edu) at Stanford in 2019. 

Lab
------
I lead the Penn Power Electronics Research Lab. My lab focuses on technology innovations centered around wide bandgap devices, high-frequency magnetic components, circuits and architectures, and others to improve the efficiency and shrink the requisite size of power conversion for a wide range of essential applications. [Here](https://leigupe.github.io/research/) highlights some of my past research.
