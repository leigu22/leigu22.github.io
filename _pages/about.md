Hi! I am a visiting researcher in the circuits group at [NVIDIA Research](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/). I am broadly interested in [power electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_electronics) circuits and components and how to design and optimize power conversion systems for applications, such as high-performance computing, renewable energy, and medical devices. 

I will join the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu) [Electrical and Systems Engineering Department](https://www.ese.upenn.edu) as an Assistant Professor in January 2023. My lab will focus on technology innovations centered around wide bandgap devices, high-frequency magnetic components, circuits and architectures, and others to improve the efficiency and shrink the requisite size of power conversion for a wide range of essential applications.
