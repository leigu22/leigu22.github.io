Hi! I am a visiting researcher in the circuits group at NVIDIA Research. I am broadly interested in power electronics circuits and components and how to design and optimize power conversion systems for applications, such as high-performance computing, renewable energy, and medical devices. 

I will join the University of Pennsylvania Electrical and Systems Engineering Department as an Assistant Professor in January 2023. My lab will focus on technology innovations centered around wide bandgap devices, high-frequency magnetic components, circuits and architectures, and others to improve the efficiency and shrink the requisite size of power conversion for a wide range of essential applications.
