## About
I am an Assistant Professor in the [Electrical and Systems Engineering Department](https://www.ese.upenn.edu) at the University of Pennsylvania. I am broadly interested in [power electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_electronics) circuits and components and how to design and optimize power conversion systems for applications, such as high-performance computing, renewable energy, and medical devices. I am also a visiting researcher in the circuits group at [NVIDIA Research](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/), working on data center power delivery. Before NVIDIA, I worked at Apple. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from [Stanford](https://ee.stanford.edu) in 2019.

## Group
I lead the Penn Power Electronics Research Lab. My lab focuses on technology innovations centered around wide bandgap devices, high-frequency magnetic components, circuits and architectures, and others to improve the efficiency and shrink the requisite size of power conversion for a wide range of essential applications. [Here](https://leigupe.github.io/research/) highlights some of my past research.

## Potential students

[Postdoc opening in power managament integrated circutis, open until filled](http://leigupe.github.io/files/UPenn_Postdoc_Opening_2025.pdf)

I will be taking new graduate students in the foreseeable future. If you are interested in working with me at Penn, please apply to [Penn Engineeringâ€™s graduate program](https://gradadm.seas.upenn.edu), and mention my name in your application. Please be mindful that I receive a large number of emails from prospective students asking me to evaluate their resumes and inquiring about research assistantships in my group. Please do not be discouraged if I do not respond or respond only with a short email due to limited bandwidth. I tend to take on 1-3 new students each year, and so I need to be selective and defer the evaluations and decisions until I see the entire pool of applicants in December. For master students, I recommend you take my course ESE5800 or ESE6710 first.
